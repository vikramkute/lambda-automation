Flow 1: Trigger Lambda Function on S3 File Upload

1. Upload a file to the source S3 bucket.
2. The upload event triggers Lambda function myTestFunction1.
3. Lambda function myTestFunction1 reads the document content.
4. Transforms the content to uppercase.
5. Writes the transformed file to the destination S3 bucket.


Flow 2: Trigger Lambda Function via API Gateway

1. API Gateway receives a POST request with JSON data and invokes myTestFunction2.
2. myTestFunction2 processes the JSON data and uploads a file to the source S3 bucket.
3. The upload event triggers Lambda function myTestFunction1.
4. Lambda function myTestFunction1 reads the document content.
5. Transforms the content to uppercase.
6. Writes the transformed file to the destination S3 bucket.


Flow 3: Trigger Lambda Function via EventBridge Scheduler

1. Scheduler triggers at a specific time and passes JSON data to myTestFunction2.
2. myTestFunction2 creates a file with the JSON data and uploads it to the source S3 bucket.
3. The upload event triggers Lambda function myTestFunction1.
4. Lambda function myTestFunction1 reads the document content.
5. Transforms the content to uppercase.
6. Writes the transformed file to the destination S3 bucket.
